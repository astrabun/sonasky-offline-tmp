# SonaSky is Temporarily Offline

SonaSky is offline for a planned maintenance window.

## Notes

Astra is moving and needs to move the server hosting SonaSky to a new location. This planned downtime will be used to transport the server and hook it up at the new location.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

The downtime is expected to last for some/all of August 31, 2025. During this time, adding/removing labels to your account will not work, and SonaSky REF will also be offline.

Plase check back on [sonasky.app](https://sonasky.app/) for updates/details.

Thank you again.
